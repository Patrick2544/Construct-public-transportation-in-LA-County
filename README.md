# About the Project
This is the research project for my Advanced Data Structure class under the topic: **Utilize Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm to construct a public transportation system**. At the end, 25-minute [presentation](https://github.com/Patrick2544/Kruskal-algorithm-on-public-transportation/blob/main/PDF%20Slides.pdf) was required with a powerpoint slides in IEEE format. The project is inspired by the [public transportation](https://cdn-cms.pgimgs.com/static/2019/07/mrta_bangkok-metro-system-map.png) system in [Bangkok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok), my hometown.

## Project Goals
This project aims to extend public transportation access across LA County, providing viable alternatives for commuting without relying on cars.

# The Project's Outcome
Note: The schematic map is not up to scale

The final outcome is the combination of implementing Kruskal's MST algorithm multiple times with different datasets.

* There are a total of 74 stations divided into 9 color lines
  * Orange Line: 16 stations
  * Yellow Line: 8 stations
  * Light Green Line: 11 stations
  * Dark Green Line: 10 stations
  * Red Line: 18 stations
  * Pink Line: 12 stations
  * Purple Line: 10 stations
  * Light Blue Line: 8 stations
  * Navy Blue Line: 7 stations
