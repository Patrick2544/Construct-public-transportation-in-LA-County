# About the Project
This is the research project for my Advanced Data Structure class under the topic: **Utilize Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm to construct a public transportation system**. At the end, 25-minute [presentation](https://github.com/Patrick2544/Kruskal-algorithm-on-public-transportation/blob/main/PDF%20Slides.pdf) was required with a powerpoint slides in IEEE format. The project is inspired by the [public transportation](https://cdn-cms.pgimgs.com/static/2019/07/mrta_bangkok-metro-system-map.png) system in [Bangkok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok), my hometown.

## Project Goals
This project aims to extend public transportation access across LA County, providing viable alternatives for commuting without relying on cars.

# The Project's Outcome
Note: The schematic map is not up to scale

![Final Transportation map](https://github.com/Patrick2544/Kruskal-algorithm-on-public-transportation/assets/52234759/5c33761c-ea7c-498d-b031-0ac834243d2e)

The final outcome is the combination of implementing Kruskal's MST algorithm multiple times with different datasets.

* There are a total of 74 stations divided into 9 color lines
  * Orange Line: 16 stations
  * Yellow Line: 8 stations
  * Light Green Line: 11 stations
  * Dark Green Line: 10 stations
  * Red Line: 18 stations
  * Pink Line: 12 stations
  * Purple Line: 10 stations
  * Light Blue Line: 8 stations
  * Navy Blue Line: 7 stations

# Contributions
The project has 3 major contributions
* Economy
  * The purpose is to connect small cities with lower populations to the economic powerhouses of larger cities.
  * It enhances economic opportunities for residents in smaller communities
  * It also actively contributes to reducing economic disparities between these regions.

* Accessibility
  * The system prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring that a wide demographic can benefit from its services. 
  * The commitment to accessibility extends to people with disabilities, low-income group, and people who are living in the remote areas.

* Traffic
  * Reduced traffic congestion leads to shorter commute times
  * The aim is to improve productivity and the overall quality of life for LA County residents.
  * The system prioritizes road safety to reduce the chances of accidents while driving.

# Limitations

* Single Algorithm Approach
  * A combination of algorithms could better address the complex and multifaceted challenges in transportation planning.

* Geographical Region
  * The project does not encompass a detailed analysis or accounting for the unique geographical characteristics of Los Angeles County.

* Budget Constraints
 * Building and maintaining public transportation infrastructure require substantial financial resources. 
 * The project may not address the financial feasibility of the proposed system.

# Future work

* Expansion of Destination Points
  * Add more destination points, especially in the South LA region, that are spread across LA County. Also, connect the routes with the existed bus and metro lines in LA county.

* Geographical Considerations
  * Take into account geographical features and constraints when expanding the transportation network.

* Interactive Map
  * Incorporate an interactive map displaying the transportation network that users can easily see it in real time.
